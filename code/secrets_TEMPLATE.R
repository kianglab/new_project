## secrets.R ----
## This file is always gitignored and is just a convenient place for you to 
## store information that is **not** necessary to encrypt but also things you
## do not want out in the public domain. For example, API keys that you'll 
## change very project anyways, server domains, file locations, etc. 
## 
## DO NOT STORE INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED IN THIS FILE. 
## 
## To use, just `source(here::here("code", "secrets.R"))` in the file where
## you need the variables. 

API_KEY <- "PUT YOUR API HERE HERE"
